# Lewis' Caddy-based Webserver
My goal with this project is to have a configured webserver I can be proud of, that is easy to set up and modify.
I will aim to put README files in each directory to explain how they are useful.

## Dependencies
- [Doctl](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/) is the command line tool required to authenticate/interact with the DO Container Registry.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) is required to run containerised web apps.
- [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for container orchestration.
